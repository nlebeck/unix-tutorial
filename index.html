<h1>Getting Started with Unix</h1>
<p>
This tutorial will teach you how to perform basic tasks with the Unix command
line, including reading and editing files, browsing directories, searching for
files, and accessing remote machines. The goal of this tutorial is to teach
a basic set of skills without overwhelming the reader, and to provide pointers
to more advanced sources for further reading.
</p>
<h2>1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
All you need is a computer running a Unix operating system. If you have a Mac
running macOS, you're good to go: macOS is a Unix operating system under the
hood. If you have a Windows computer, don't fret!  You can install Linux on a
virtual machine. See
<a href="linux-vm.html">here</a> for instructions.
</p>
<h2>2. The terminal</h2>
<p>
In this tutorial, you'll interact with Unix through a terminal. The terminal
runs a program called a <i>shell</i> that accepts text commands from the user
and prints text output. The default shell on Ubuntu and macOS is Bash. 
</p>
<p>
Let's open a terminal window that we will use for the rest of the tutorial.
On Ubuntu, right-click on the desktop and select "Open Terminal." On macOS,
open the Terminal app. A window will pop up displaying a line that looks like
this: <code>user@machine:~$</code> with a blinking cursor at the end.
</p>
<h3>3. Your first command: ls</h3>
<p>
You interact with the terminal by running <i>commands</i>, programs that
produce text output. You run a command by typing its name in the terminal and
pressing the Enter key. The <code>ls</code> command lists files in the current
directory. Type <code>ls</code> into the terminal and hit Enter. You'll see a
list of file and directory names that looks something like this:
</p>
<p>
<code>Desktop Downloads Music Public Videos</code>
<br>
<code>Documents Pictures Templates</code>
</p>
<p>
You just ran your first command! Now let's learn more about files and
commands.
</p>
<h2>4. More about files and directories</h2>
<p>
We'll start with looking at the files and directories on your computer. The
Unix file system is a tree made of files and <i>directories</i>, special
files that can hold other files. The <i>root directory</i> is the base of the
tree. Whether you've used macOS or Windows in the past, you're probably used to
browsing a similar file system with a graphical interface. The main difference
here is that we're going to interact with the file system through terminal
commands.
</p>
<p>
A <i>path</i> describes the location of a file. It consists of directories
separated by forward slashes, where each subsequent directory
is inside the previous directory, and ends in a file. An <i>absolute path</i>
gives the location of the file starting from the root directory.
For example, the path
<code>/tmp/logs/output.txt</code> gives the location of a file called "output.txt",
which is inside the directory "logs," which is inside the directory "tmp," which is
inside the root directory. The absolute path to the root directory is simply the
forward slash: <code>/</code>.
</p>
<p>
The terminal always has a <i>working directory</i>. You can think of it as the
current directory that you're "inside:" many commands will apply to the working
directory by default. For instance, the <code>ls</code> command that we ran
earlier shows the files in your working directory by default. Which directory
was our working directory when we ran <code>ls</code>? A newly-opened terminal
window starts with its working directory set to your <i>home directory</i>.
Your home directory holds configuration files, and on a Unix machine with
many users, the home directory is where you would put your files. The absolute
path to your home directory is something like <code>/home/myusername</code>,
but you can refer to it with the shortcut symbol <code>~</code>. In many
situations, the terminal knows how to expand this symbol into the absolute
path of your home directory.
</p>
<p>
Just what is the absolute path to your home directory? Let's use the <code>pwd</code>
command to find out. The <code>pwd</code> command prints the path to your current
working directory ("Print Working Directory"). Type <code>pwd</code> and hit Enter,
and you should see the absolute path to your home directory.
