<title>Getting Started with Unix</title>

<p>
This tutorial will teach you how to perform basic tasks with the Unix command
line, including reading and editing files, browsing directories, searching for
files, and accessing remote machines. The goal of this tutorial is to teach
a basic set of skills without overwhelming the reader, and to provide pointers
to more advanced sources for further reading.
</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>
All you need is a computer running a Unix operating system. If you have a Mac
running macOS, you're good to go. If you have a Windows computer, don't fret!
You can install Linux on a virtual machine.
</p>
<h2>Installing Linux on a virtual machine</h2>
<p>
A virtual machine (or VM) is an operating system running on top of another one
(the actual definition is more nuanced, but this definition works fine for our
purposes). A program called the <i>hypervisor</i> tricks the virtual machine
into thinking it's running directly on top of the hardware like a normal
operating system. We'll use Oracle's VirtualBox program as a hypervisor to run
Linux (feel free to use a different hypervisor, like VMWare Player or Hyper-V,
if you already have experience with one).
</p>
<p>
Linux comes in multiple different <i>distributions</i>. Each distribution
takes the base Linux operating system and adds tools and software to it.
We'll use the Ubuntu distribution. Most of this tutorial applies to any
distribution, but in situations where distributions differ, we'll provide
details for Ubuntu.
</p>
<p>
Download and install the most recent version of VirtualBox from the
<a href=https://www.virtualbox.org>VirtualBox website</a>.
Then download the recommended desktop version of Ubuntu from the
<a href=https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop>Ubuntu website</a>.
The download will be a disk image (an ISO file). Start up VirtualBox, and click
the "New" button to create a new virtual machine. Name your virtual machine,
set its type to "Linux," and set the version to "Ubuntu (64-bit)." On the next
screen, leave the default RAM allocation. On the screen after that, choose to
create a virtual hard disk. When creating the virtual hard disk, use the default
settings for file type (VDI) and storage (dynamically allocated), and set its
size to 16GB (the default size of 8GB will fill up pretty quickly).
</p>
<p>
Now start up your virtual machine. When it asks for a startup disk, select the
Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded earlier. Now you'll proceed through the Ubuntu
installation process, just like you were installing Ubuntu directly onto your
computer. The first set of options (whether to download updates during
installation and whether to install third-party software) come down to personal
preference -- for this tutorial, we won't be using any of that third-party
software, so there's no need to install it. For installation type, select
"Erase disk and install Ubuntu" (you're installing Ubuntu onto a virtual hard
disk, so it won't actually erase anything). Click "Continue" when
it asks you to confirm the changes to the disk. The rest of the installation
process consists of typical things like choosing your time zone and keyboard
layout and picking an account name and password. At the end of the installer,
you'll be asked to restart the virtual machine.
</p>
<p>
The installer is finished, but we're not quite done! We just have to install
a set of "guest additions" that VirtualBox provides to make the guest operating
system (that is, Ubuntu) run more smoothly as a virtual machine. Start up
your virtual machine and log in. In the "Devices" menu at the top of your
VM window, select "Insert Guest Additions CD Image..." (VirtualBox installs
these guest additions by pretending to insert a CD into the virtual machine).
A window will pop up asking for your approval to run a script and then your
password, followed by a terminal window as the installer runs. Once the
terminal window closes, the installer is finished. You're ready to use your
Ubuntu virtual machine!
