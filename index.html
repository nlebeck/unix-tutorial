<h1>Getting Started with Unix</h1>
<p>
This tutorial will teach you how to perform basic tasks with the Unix command
line, including reading and editing files, browsing directories, searching for
files, and accessing remote machines. The goal of this tutorial is to teach
a basic set of skills without overwhelming the reader, and to provide pointers
to more advanced sources for further reading.
</p>
<h2>1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
All you need is a computer running a Unix operating system. If you have a Mac
running macOS, you're good to go: macOS is a Unix operating system under the
hood. If you have a Windows computer, don't fret!  You can install Linux on a
virtual machine. See
<a href="linux-vm.html">here</a> for instructions.
</p>
<h2>2. The terminal</h2>
<p>
In this tutorial, you'll interact with Unix through a terminal. The terminal
runs a program called a <i>shell</i> that accepts text commands from the user
and prints text output. The default shell on Ubuntu and macOS is called Bash. 
</p>
<p>
Let's open a terminal window that we will use for the rest of the tutorial.
On Ubuntu, right-click on the desktop and select "Open Terminal." On macOS,
open the Terminal app. A window will pop up displaying a line that looks like
this: <code>myname@mycomputer:~$</code> with a blinking cursor at the end.
</p>
<h2>3. Your first command: <i>ls</i></h2>
<p>
You interact with the terminal by running <i>commands</i>, programs that
produce text output. You run a command by typing its name in the terminal and
pressing the Enter key. The <code>ls</code> command lists files in the current
working directory. Type <code>ls</code> into the terminal and hit Enter. You'll
see a list of file and directory names that looks something like this:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~$ ls
<br>

</div>
<p>
You just ran your first command!
</p>
<h2>4. More about files and directories</h2>
<p>
We'll start with looking at the files on your computer. The
Unix file system is a tree made of files and <i>directories</i>, special
files that can hold other files. The <i>root directory</i> is the base of the
tree. Whether you've used macOS or Windows in the past, you're probably used to
browsing a similar file system with a graphical interface. The main difference
here is that we're going to interact with the file system through terminal
commands.
</p>
<h3>4.1 File paths and the working directory</h3>
<p>
A <i>path</i> describes the location of a file. It consists of directories
separated by forward slashes, where each subsequent directory
is inside the previous directory, and ends in a file. An <i>absolute path</i>
gives the location of the file starting from the root directory.
For example, the path
<code>/tmp/logs/output.txt</code> gives the location of a file called "output.txt",
which is inside the directory "logs," which is inside the directory "tmp," which is
inside the root directory. The absolute path to the root directory is simply the
forward slash: <code>/</code>.
</p>
<p>
The terminal always has a <i>working directory</i>. You can think of it as the
current directory that you're "inside" of: many commands will apply to the
working directory by default. For instance, the <code>ls</code> command
shows the files in your working directory by default. The <i>relative path</i>
of a file is its path relative to your current working directory. For instance,
if your current working directory is <code>/tmp</code>, the relative path of
the "output.txt" file mentioned above is <code>logs/output.txt</code>.
</p>
<h3>4.2 Printing the working directory with <i>pwd</i></h3>
<p>
Which
directory is our working directory right now? Let's use the
<code>pwd</code> command to find out. The <code>pwd</code> command prints the
path to your current working directory ("Print Working Directory"). Type
<code>pwd</code> and hit Enter, and you should see something like this:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~$ pwd
<br>
/home/myname
</div>
<h3>4.3 Home directories</h3>
<p>
This directory is your <i>home directory</i>. Your home directory holds
configuration files and any other files you want to put inside it. A
newly-opened terminal window starts with its working directory set to your home
directory.
</p>
<h3>4.4 Making a directory with <i>mkdir</i></h3>
<p>
The <code>mkdir</code> command allows you to create a new directory. To use
<code>mkdir</code>, you supply a path to the new directory. Let's create a new
directory called "tutorial" inside your home directory. Enter the command
<code>mkdir tutorial</code> to do so:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~$ mkdir tutorial
<br>
myname@mycomputer:~$
</div>
<p>
You can't tell yet, but the "tutorial" directory was created. To verify that
the directory, was created, use <code>ls</code>. You'll see something like
this:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~$ ls
<br>

</div>
<p>
The output of <code>ls</code> has changed to show the new directory.
</p>
<h3>4.5 Changing the working directory with <i>cd</i></h3>
<p>
The <code>cd</code> command ("change directory") allows us to change the
working directory by entering the path of a different directory.
To change directories to the "tutorial" directory we just created,
enter the command <code>cd tutorial</code>:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~$ cd tutorial
<br>
myname@mycomputer:~/tutorial$
</div>
<p>
Note that the terminal prompt changed to reflect the new working directory.
The <code>cd</code> command, like many commands, takes either an absolute or
relative path. We used a relative path above, but we could have used an absolute
path by entering <code>cd /home/myname/tutorial</code> (replacing <code>myname</code>
with your user name).
</p>
<p>
<h3>4.6 Directory shortcuts</h3>
There are a few shortcuts that make life easier when typing out file paths.
The first two are shortcuts that are provided by the file system itself.  Each
directory contains a special directory called <code>.</code> (that's right, a single period) referring to
itself and another special directory called <code>..</code> referring to its
parent.  Using the second shortcut, we can use <code>cd</code> to move from the
"tutorial" directory back to our home directory, its parent:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~/tutorial$ cd ..
<br>
myname@mycomputer:~$
</div>
<p>
These shortcuts can appear anywhere inside of a path and are applied relative
to the directory named by the path so far. For instance, we can change directories to
the "tutorial" directory using a longer and more silly route:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~$ cd tutorial/../tutorial
<br>
myname@mycomputer:~/tutorial$
</div>
<p>
For a more useful example of using this shortcut inside of a longer path, let's say
we now want to change directories to the "Music" directory
inside our home directory. We could do so with the following command:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~/tutorial$ cd ../Music
<br>
myname@mycomputer:~/Music$
</div>
<p>
Because the two shortcuts we just learned are provided by the file system, you
aren't limited to using them in the terminal. You can use them anywhere you
would use a file path -- for instance, when opening a file inside of a program.
The shortcut we're about to learn now is a little different in that it's
handled by the shell, so you can only use it when you're typing file paths
on the command line. If you place <code>~</code> (a tilde) at the beginning
of a path, it refers to your home directory. We can change directories to the
"tutorial" directory yet again using this shortcut:
</p>
<div class="codeblock">
myname@mycomputer:~/Music$ cd ~/tutorial
<br>
myname@mycomputer:~/tutorial$
</div>
<p>
Over time, using <code>..</code> to refer to the parent of a directory and
using <code>~</code> to refer to your home directory will become second nature.
The uses of the <code>.</code> shortcut are not quite as obvious, but we'll
see some later.
