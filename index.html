<h1>Getting Started with Unix</h1>
<p>
This tutorial will teach you how to perform basic tasks with the Unix command
line, including reading and editing files, browsing directories, searching for
files, and accessing remote machines. The goal of this tutorial is to teach
a basic set of skills without overwhelming the reader, and to provide pointers
to more advanced sources for further reading.

All you need is a computer running a Unix operating system. If you have a Mac
running macOS, you're good to go. If you have a Windows computer, don't fret!
You can install Linux on a virtual machine. See
